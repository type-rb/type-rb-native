# Current reference compatibility

The current development pin is TypeRB `0.4.6-dev` at
`4e1327c9af1b4caec9963756e6ffbc0e2ef56341`, the merged
[loop-transfer snapshot update](https://github.com/type-rb/type-rb/pull/657).
Snapshot v3/v4 encode nearest-while transfers and early method returns with
existing jumps and live block arguments. The format and v2 boundary remain
unchanged. Both `elsif-recovery` and `loop-transfer-recovery` run through
snapshot encoding, strict program decoding, recovery QBE emission and execution.

The Native implementation is accepted
`4e1d0b4aee97b9a5bd73a98f918b31d47985da25` from PR #337.
[Exact-head acceptance](https://github.com/type-rb/type-rb-native/actions/runs/34166076931)
passed all selected recovery, ordinary CLI, target, memory and comparative-cost
authorities at the preceding reference pin. That is the implementation baseline,
not acceptance of this reference update. Fresh enabled suites and every
applicable hosted authority are required before merge. Seed registration is
separate from publication, actual published-asset verification and checkout pins.

The preceding pin was `f6229c5657a5acb40194cde71785a63754d00355` from
[TypeRB PR #655](https://github.com/type-rb/type-rb/pull/655).
Its [source-era compatibility record](https://github.com/type-rb/type-rb-native/blob/4e1d0b4aee97b9a5bd73a98f918b31d47985da25/results/2026-09-07-string-escape-reference-compatibility/README.md)
retains the earlier conditional and logical-condition checkpoint identities.

## Previous String-escape checkpoint

The preceding experimental update selected TypeRB `0.4.6-dev` at
`47a160cae05ddc2035c7430735c4762d36bbc9c4`, the source revision of
[TypeRB PR #651](https://github.com/type-rb/type-rb/pull/651).
The dependent Native update requires that reference PR to merge first.

Native implementation `07fc9af5e4d8b099865297820068140222ade47e` passed
[Native CLI workflow 34081476080](https://github.com/type-rb/type-rb-native/actions/runs/34081476080)
on Darwin arm64 and Linux arm64. Both jobs build from the unchanged pinned
Native seed, verify core and CLI fixed points, run CLI and typed REPL cases,
exercise escape and interpolation errors, render terminal editing and history,
and verify unchanged checkout inputs reuse the executable.

Local Darwin arm64 checks with the exact selected reference also pass:

- reference checks for the root, compiler and isolated CLI source projects;
- String escape and interpolation file/REPL differential tests;
- shared reference/Native REPL screen and history tests.

The implementation accepts escaped hashes in source while keeping JSON history
validation separate. The new reference requires typed filesystem paths and
immutable record fields; adapters construct `Path` values and CLI state uses
mutable Array elements or replacement session records.

This is bounded source, String and CLI compatibility evidence. It is not a
version range, complete language conformance claim or performance measurement.
Full recovery, target, memory and performance checks on the final PR revision
remain the required acceptance authorities. Published bootstrap assets and
previous measurement contracts retain their original revisions.

The [previous compatibility record](https://github.com/type-rb/type-rb-native/blob/5cf61c740aa600c34ed94f1b130ea2ffefd9e783/results/2026-08-31-typerb-0-4-4-compatibility-darwin-linux-arm64/README.md)
remains available at its exact archived revision.
