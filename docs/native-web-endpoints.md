# Checked Web endpoint contracts

A configured Web project can describe a file-route handler with the existing
`trb/web` endpoint declarations. In `src/routes/items.trb`:

```trb
import { Context, Response, Endpoint, handles, response } from trb/web

record Item
  id: Integer
  title: String
end

def get(_context: Context): Response
  return Response.json(Item.new(id: 1, title: "sample"))
end

class ItemsEndpoint < Endpoint
  handles(get)
  response<Item>(status: 200)
end
```

The contract class directly extends the owned `Endpoint`, names exactly one
local file-route handler and declares one or more unique literal response
statuses from 100 through 599. Optional `input<T>()` declares the input envelope.
The ordinary checker resolves the handler signature, type arguments and marker
function identities. Marker calls are compile-time metadata and never execute
as route or program behavior. Runtime input binding and response construction
remain explicit application operations; declarations do not infer or validate
an implementation's responses automatically.

## OpenAPI generation

```sh
./trbn web openapi --config trbconfig.jsonc
./trbn web openapi --output docs/openapi.json --title "Sample API" --api-version 1.0
```

The target-neutral command uses the project's checked endpoint catalog. It emits
OpenAPI 3.1 in every declared project mode without invoking a compiler toolchain,
server, handler or program entry point. The pinned integration requires a project
with a `main` entry, although generation never runs it. See the
[CLI contract](native-cli.md) for defaults and atomic file output.

An input envelope is a non-nullable, non-generic record containing only `params`,
`query` and `body`. Path parameters match the route exactly and are required.
Query fields retain declaration order; nullable fields and repeated array fields
are optional. The body is required JSON when declared. Response status codes
that prohibit bodies require `Unit`.

JSON schemas cover Boolean, portable Integer, Float, String, nullable types,
arrays, String-keyed hashes, records, raw String/Integer enums, transparent aliases,
newtypes and the portable time scalars. Record properties use their JSON wire
names. Components retain declaration identity and reject colliding public names;
required fields retain declaration order. Paths, methods, status maps and component
maps are deterministic.

The pinned generator rejects recursive and generic schemas, generic aliases,
catch-all routes, unsupported parameter shapes and invalid JSON field names.
These are generation-only restrictions: an otherwise valid ordinary program
continues to check and execute. A project with no endpoint contracts cannot
produce an OpenAPI document.

## Identity restrictions and verification

The current reference accepts a renamed superclass import but does not recognize
renamed marker functions or a type alias as the superclass. Renamed time imports
are rejected by OpenAPI; transparent time aliases work. A renamed `Unit` import
is an ordinary empty-record response schema, whereas canonical `Unit` and a
transparent alias of it describe a bodyless response. Native preserves these
reference distinctions pending the [canonical identity decision](https://github.com/type-rb/type-rb-native/issues/1207).

Owned contracts do not grant metadata privileges to unrelated class bodies or
local declarations with the same names. General class-body call execution is
still an [ordinary language gap](https://github.com/type-rb/type-rb-native/issues/1208); it is rejected explicitly rather than silently
removed. Browser-client generation and network serving are separate providers.

Shared ordinary cases cover checking, compilation, execution and REPL loading.
Provider units check ownership, corrupted catalog identities and types, and
source-erased MIR emission. `tools/native-web-openapi-test.py` compares complete
reference-derived documents and checks configuration modes, metadata overrides,
output replacement, failures, path constraints and absence of external tools.
