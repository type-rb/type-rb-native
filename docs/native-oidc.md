# Native OIDC Bearer authentication

Compiled applications implement `Bearer.verify`, `Bearer.authenticate` and
`Bearer.principal` from the pinned `trb/web/auth/bearer` package. Public records,
validation order, error kinds and stable messages follow `TYPE_RB_REVISION`.
The retained reference REPL has no OIDC adapter; Native preserves its explicit
diagnostic before validation or network access. It does not invoke a Go process.

The TypeRB provider owns configuration, header/token parsing, typed JSON
compatibility, key selection, claims, cache transitions and Web context values.
Verified MIR selects narrow host adapters for synchronous HTTP retrieval, RS256
verification, strict UTS46 conversion, URI/IP parsing, environment access and
clock/integer conversion.
Authored paths or lookalike declarations cannot authorize those adapters.

## Authentication behavior

Authorization accepts exactly one Bearer header. Discovery precedes token
decoding when no explicit JWKS URI is configured. Tokens require RS256 and a key
identifier. Keys require RSA, at least 2048 modulus bits, and an odd exponent of
at least three encoded in no more than four bytes. Verification uses SHA-256 and
PKCS#1 v1.5 through OpenSSL EVP; it does not implement RSA in TypeRB.

Issuer, audience, expiration, optional not-before, subject and configured roles
are checked in reference order. Metadata/JWKS typed fields preserve the reference
JSON field matching and null behavior. Claims retain float64 number semantics
instead of passing through the public JSON codec's portable Integer conversion.

Discovery is cached by issuer and keys by JWKS URI for five minutes. An unknown
key identifier can force a refresh, throttled for thirty seconds; a failed
refresh retains prior usable keys and the throttle. The single managed mutator
and synchronous boundary make each cache transition indivisible.

Successful middleware attaches a typed principal to the context passed to the
next handler. It leaves the original context unchanged. All authentication
failures produce the reference JSON 401 response and `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`.

## HTTP and trust boundary

Each retrieval has a five-second total deadline across redirects. Only HTTP and
HTTPS are accepted; the tenth redirect is rejected. Non-200 responses fail
without waiting for their body. Successful bodies are bounded to 1 MiB after
decompression. Only gzip is automatically decoded, including concatenated
members; other content encodings remain opaque as in the reference transport.

Proxy selection is TypeRB-owned and captured on first use: uppercase
`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` take precedence over lowercase forms.
Loopback bypass, host/domain/port/CIDR matching and the CGI HTTP proxy rejection
are distinct from libcurl's defaults. `ALL_PROXY` is outside the reference policy.
HTTPS proxies use CONNECT while preserving end-server certificate verification.

TLS uses one static OpenSSL build shared by libcurl, RSA and digest consumers.
The minimum TLS version is 1.2. Automatic OpenSSL configuration and provider/engine
loading are disabled; `OPENSSL_CONF` cannot change this profile.

On macOS, an unset or empty `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` selects OS platform
trust through Security.framework. A nonempty override selects disk roots. Linux
probes the Go reference's first readable bundle and certificate directories;
those variables override the respective lists. Directory entries are ordinary
PEM files, not OpenSSL hash links. No Mozilla bundle is silently added, and
OpenSSL's compiled default paths are not used. Comparisons record the Go
toolchain, generated module version and environment; the current baseline is
Go 1.27 with its default platform-override behavior.

HTTPS negotiates HTTP/2 through ALPN with HTTP/1.1 fallback; cleartext stays
HTTP/1.1. libcurl uses the pinned nghttp2 implementation and threaded DNS resolver.
This profile does not expose a general HTTP client or server TLS API. Shared
database TLS and immutable release qualification remain separate work.

Before URL parsing, TypeRB normalizes endpoint and redirect authorities using
Unicode 17 non-transitional UTS46, with STD3, bidi, joiner, hyphen and DNS-length
checks. ICU supplies that conversion through a narrow C ABI; TypeRB retains
root-dot handling, strict numeric IPv4, IPv6 serialization and URL policy.
Hostnames used in HTTP authority, CONNECT, SNI and certificate verification agree.
Unicode NO_PROXY domains undergo the same conversion. Path/query escapes remain
unchanged; percent-encoded UTF-8 hosts are accepted but encoded ASCII hosts,
ambiguous numeric hosts and scoped IPv6 addresses are rejected. The configured
issuer, discovery issuer and JWT issuer still require exact string equality.

Only ICU common code and the 60,960-byte `uts46.nrm` data package are linked.
`UDATA_NO_FILES` disables data-file lookup, including `ICU_DATA`; no ICU shared
library or external data bundle is needed. ICU uses the platform C++ runtime.
The ordinary compiler, lockfile hashing and non-OIDC applications do not select
these libraries.

## Dependencies and installation

| Consumer | Selected libraries |
| --- | --- |
| Core compiler and lockfile checksum | No OIDC/crypto libraries |
| Full CLI and retained REPL | Existing static libcrypto; no OIDC client |
| Compiled Bearer application | libcurl, libssl, libcrypto, zlib, nghttp2, ICU common/UTS46 data and platform C++ runtime; existing Web transport dependencies also apply |
| Web response compression | Existing libdeflate, independently of OIDC gzip decoding |

[oidc-dependencies.json](../tools/oidc-dependencies.json) pins curl, zlib, nghttp2 and ICU by
release archive SHA-256 and upstream revision. OpenSSL comes from the existing
[crypto pins](../tools/crypto-dependencies.json), with the same configuration and
accepted `libcrypto.a` used by all TLS/crypto consumers. zlib supplies bounded
streaming decoding; libdeflate remains the separate whole-response gzip encoder.

The builder isolates ambient header/library search variables and pins both the
OpenSSL archives and include directory. It preprocesses libcurl's actual TLS
translation unit with its generated compiler command and rejects any OpenSSL
header outside the qualified source installation. The receipt records this
header check as well as the static-link ABI probe.

Source downloads use at most three attempts at the same pinned URL, retaining
the 60-second socket timeout and waiting one, then two seconds between attempts.
Only DNS, timeout, connection failures and HTTP 408/429/500/502/503/504 are
retryable; each failed attempt is logged. Certificate failures, other HTTP
errors, and archive size or SHA-256 mismatches fail immediately. A failed or
partial download never replaces the cache, and an invalid existing cache is
preserved and rejected. These retries do not change the dependency pins or
artifact qualification checks.

Contributor builds require C/C++ toolchains, Perl, make and CMake. ICU build
tools use additional source components temporarily; the installed application
archives contain only common code and the selected UTS46 data:


```sh
python3 tools/build-crypto-dependencies.py --archives /path/to/shared-crypto-sources --output bin/crypto
python3 tools/build-oidc-dependencies.py --archives /path/to/shared-oidc-sources \
  --crypto-archives /path/to/shared-crypto-sources --crypto bin/crypto --output bin/oidc
python3 tools/oidc_artifact_smoke.py bin/oidc --crypto bin/crypto --receipt oidc-link.json
```

Build-time lookup uses `oidc/` beside QBE or `TRBN_OIDC_LIB_DIR`; crypto uses the
existing matching crypto directory. Neither location is required at application
runtime. Applications statically contain both `TRBN-OIDC-V1` and
`TRBN-CRYPTO-V1` inventories. The OIDC receipt records the exact crypto archive
and configuration against which libssl/libcurl were built. Inspect and package
them with `tools/oidc_artifacts.py` and `tools/crypto_artifacts.py`.

Each OIDC artifact retains curl, zlib, nghttp2, ICU and OpenSSL notices. The crypto bundle
also retains its OpenSSL notice. Darwin links Security, CoreFoundation and
SystemConfiguration frameworks and platform libc++. Linux links platform
libstdc++ and thread/dynamic-loader support. The artifact
CI matrix covers Darwin/Linux arm64/amd64; it is separate from ordinary compiler
host support and does not fill the darwin-amd64 compiler gap. Immutable release
publication and advisory/update ownership remain in [#1257](https://github.com/type-rb/type-rb-native/issues/1257).

## Lifetime and validation

Foreign callbacks operate on native buffers without invoking managed code.
Handles, RSA objects, trust-store parsing objects and gzip state are released
before returning. Managed body/error/redirect values are copied only at owned
allocation boundaries. Upstream process-global caches retain their documented
lifetime; they are distinct from per-request resources.

`tools/native-oidc-test.py` runs the same synthetic issuer/key/token corpus against
the pinned reference and Native, with local HTTP/HTTPS fixtures. It covers
middleware context propagation, invalid credentials, discovery/JWKS errors,
refresh behavior, proxies, redirects, trust overrides and bounded decompression.
Its `--stress` mode instruments emitted code with forced GC and foreign allocation
failures, verifies exact resource release, and uses a blocking configuration FIFO
to test OpenSSL initialization isolation. These probes are test-only C ABI
instrumentation, not repository-owned C runtime implementation.

Declaration/MIR tests reject changed ownership, parameters, mutation, bodies,
results and effects, including after source erasure. Pinned-header ABI assertions
cover libcurl/OpenSSL/zlib/nghttp2/ICU constants, native structs and platform interfaces.
`tools/native-oidc-http2-test.py` uses an independent local Go HTTP/2 server
(test-only) to require negotiated HTTP/2, fallback, gzip, redirect, size, stream
reset and deadline behavior. `tools/native-oidc-hostname-test.py` verifies actual
HTTP authorities, redirects, proxy bypass, CONNECT/SNI/certificate checks and
unchanged issuer identities against the pinned reference. Both offer forced-GC
ownership probes; Native application compilation blocks Go/reference fallback.

Artifact smoke tests run all 6,391 fixed official Unicode 17 ToASCII cases,
verify relocated data/TLS operation, embedded inventories and absence of dynamic
TLS/ICU dependencies. Local checks, hosted target validation and immutable
release qualification remain separate evidence.
